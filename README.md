# Pattie Ye's Mini Data Analysis

## Milestones

- [x] Milestone 1: Due October 9, 2021
- [ ] Milestone 2: Due October 19, 2021
- [ ] Milestone 3: Due October 28, 2021

## Purpose of this repository

This repository contains the work required to complete the Mini Data Analysis project for STAT 545A

## Learning Objectives

### Milestone 1

* Become familiar with my dataset of choosing
* Think of 4 questions that I would like to answer with your data
* Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown

### Milestone 2

* Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing my data in tibbles using `dplyr` and `tidyr`, with a research question in mind.
* Understand what /tidy/ data is, and how to create it. In milestone 3 we will explore when this might be useful.
* Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown.
* Gain a greater understanding of how to use R to answer research questions about my data.

### Milestone 3

Sharpen results obtained from previous milestone by:

* Manipulating special data types in R: factors and/or dates and times.
* Fitting a model object to my data, and extract a result.
* Reading and writing data as separate files.
